# Simple Discord Bot - README

This is a simple Discord bot that can perform the following actions: say hello, roll a dice, add numbers, and divide numbers. The bot responds to specific keywords and modifiers in messages.

# Commands

To interact with the bot, use the following keywords:

1. `hello`: The bot responds with a friendly greeting.
2. `roll`: The bot rolls a six-sided dice and responds with the result (a random number from 1 to 6).
3. `add`: The bot adds any numbers included in the message and responds with the result.
4. `div`: The bot divides any numbers included in the message and responds with the result.

# How to Use

1. Add the bot to your Discord server.
2. Use the bot's commands by typing the desired keyword followed by any necessary parameters.
   For example, to roll a dice, send the message: `roll`
   To add numbers, send the message: `add 5 10 15`
   To divide numbers, send the message: `div 20 2`
3. If you want the bot to send the messages privately, prefix your message with a question mark `?`.   
   For example: `?hello`

he bot will respond with the appropriate message in the same channel where the command was issued or in a private message if the command is prefixed with `?`.

# Deployment

To deploy this bot, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Discord application and bot on the [Discord Developer Portal.](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Copy the bot token generated by Discord and set it as an environment variable named `TOKEN`.
3. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
4. Install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```
pip install discord.py
```
5. Save the bot code in a Python file (e.g., `bot.py`) and the responses code in another Python file (e.g., `responses.py`).
6. Run the bot by executing the following command in the terminal:
```
python bot.py
```
The bot should be up and running, and you can start interacting with it on your Discord server.

# Additional Information

For any additional help or to display the list of available commands, send the bot the message `help`. The bot will respond with the list of keywords and a brief explanation of each command.

Feel free to customize the bot and add more features as per your requirements. Happy coding!
